My framework:
 to test WebBased Software I use Selenium WebDriver and Java Language.
I work in BDD framework, so tool is Cucumber
 ->In addition I use Junit and its Assertions. To set up necessary dependencies I use pom.xml file which is project
 object model.
 One of the best practices to reuse web element is to create POM (pages) is Page Object Model.
 ->To use single instance of WebDriver I use Singleton pattern. where private constructor and private static WebDriver
 are declared and getDriver method is used. Singleton is useful since it represent single and unique session.
->To avoid hardcoding I use .properties file and Class to read .properties file. it is a file where I store sensitive
test data like env, credentials, settings.
-> Must is Utilities package, it serves a role of reusable methods for tables and repetitive actions that can occur
during testing. Since some actions can be repeated along different test scenarios.
-> WebDriverWait class helps to achieve proper synchronization with my test scripts.
-> What are dependencies are jar file that have necessary class and info to run tests, compile code.
-> Target can store generated test cases, html reports after each run.

Project:
  src->
  test->
     java->
         com.projectName:
            -runners
            -step_defs
            -utilities
            -pages
     resources-> Features packages to store .feature files with Scenarios
     .gitignore-> to ignore files that are not needed to be committed
     config.properties - to store credentials
     jenkins for Jenkins pipeline
     pom.xml - to store project object model and dependencies
