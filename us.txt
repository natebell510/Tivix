QA Recruitment Task
1. Create 3 different test cases on the http://qalab.pl.tivixlabs.com/
2. Based on created test cases, please write automated E2E tests (preferably using
Cypress + BDD, you can publish them to your Github account).
3. Please test the app: http://qalab.pl.tivixlabs.com/ . If you find any bugs (surely, you will ;))
please report them. Basic assumptions:
● a user should be able to search for a car in a specific country/city,
● to rent a car, the user needs to provide dates,
● the user should be able to see car details after clicking "Rent” button,
● the user should be able to provide personal data in the rent form,
● find as many bugs as you can.
In case of any questions, use your best common sense.
